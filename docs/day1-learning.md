The term “Microservice Architecture” has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services.

A monolithic application built as a single unit. Change cycles are tied together - a change made to a small part of the application, requires the entire monolith to be rebuilt and deployed.

Problems Microservices SOLVE

1. Team Scalability

Problem: 50 developers working on one codebase = constant merge conflicts, stepping on each other
Solution: Each team owns 1-2 services, can deploy independently
Real example: Netflix has 1000+ services, thousands of engineers don't block each other

2. Technology Diversity

Problem: Stuck with one tech stack for entire application
Solution: User service in Node.js, ML service in Python, legacy service in Java
Your case: Task service (Node.js) + Notification service (Python FastAPI)

3. Fault Isolation

Problem: One bug crashes entire application
Solution: If notification service fails, users can still create tasks
Real impact: 99.9% uptime instead of complete outages

4. Independent Scaling

Problem: CPU-intensive reports slow down user login
Solution: Scale report service separately, keep auth service fast
Cost benefit: Scale only what needs it vs scaling everything

5. Independent Deployment

Problem: Small bug fix requires redeploying entire app
Solution: Deploy only the changed service
Speed: Minutes vs hours for releases

Problems Microservices CREATE

1. Distributed System Complexity

New problem: Network calls can fail, timeout, or have latency
Real pain: Service A calls Service B calls Service C - if C is slow, everything is slow
Your challenge: What if user-service is down when task-service needs to validate a user?

2. Data Consistency Issues

Problem: User deleted in user-service, but tasks still exist in task-service
Complexity: No more simple database transactions across services
Solution needed: Event-driven architecture, eventual consistency

3. Operational Overhead

Before: Deploy 1 application, monitor 1 log file
After: Deploy 10 services, monitor 10 log files, 10 databases, 10 different health checks
DevOps explosion: Docker, Kubernetes, service mesh, distributed tracing

4. Testing Becomes Hard

Integration tests: Need to start all services to test one feature
Data setup: Create test data across multiple databases
Version compatibility: Service A v2.0 works with Service B v1.3 but not v1.2?

5. Network Communication

Performance: HTTP calls are 100x slower than function calls
Reliability: Networks fail, services timeout, circuit breakers needed
Security: Every service boundary is a potential attack vector

The Big Question: When Should You NOT Use Microservices?
Don't use microservices when:

Small team (< 10 developers) - overhead outweighs benefits
Simple application - CRUD app doesn't need service boundaries
Unclear boundaries - if you can't clearly separate concerns, you'll create a distributed monolith
No DevOps maturity - without proper tooling, you'll drown in operational complexity

Martin Fowler's Rule: "You shouldn't start with microservices. Start with a monolith and extract services when you hit pain points."
For Your TaskFlow Project:
Why we're doing microservices:

Learning exercise: You need to understand the patterns
Portfolio value: Shows you can handle distributed systems
Career prep: Senior engineers must know microservice trade-offs

In reality: TaskFlow could easily be a monolith. But you're learning the skills for when you join a company with 100+ developers and genuine scaling needs.
Key insight: Microservices are about organizational scaling, not just technical scaling. They solve people problems more than performance problems.
